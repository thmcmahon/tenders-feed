      <link>https://www.tenders.gov.au/Advert/Show/dc3f0d64-48df-4389-be82-11d60d617ca6</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Southern Australia is in the midst of the driest 15-month period on record. There has been a focus on supporting growers through this period with a number of measures for them and their families announced by state governments. A gap in these measures is in supporting those working in grower facing sectors of agriculture, including agronomists, farm business consultants, farming systems groups (FSGs) and regionally based researchers. These agriculturalists are farmer facing and, are important in the community and for those going through stressful times, often becoming the first, trusted port of call for discussing difficult farm decisions. The skills needed to manage self, and others through stressful decision making are critical for grower consultancy roles, and there is an immediate need to support people in analytical decision making and how to reduce the influences of emotion and stress in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PROC-9177213: Developing opportunities for soft wheat production in the Southern and Western GRDC Regions.</title>
      <link>https://www.tenders.gov.au/Advert/Show/2e024cb5-cb5f-4f06-9f9c-8bb63bd36a80</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This procurement seeks to achieve the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Complete a desktop analysis to determine suitable growing areas, varieties and agronomic packages for soft wheat production in Western Australian and South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Over 3 growing seasons starting 2026, following the desktop analysis, the applicant will conduct 5 field trials (minimum of 2 in Western Australia and 2 in South Australia) per annum in identified sub-regions for each of three years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Derived from the desktop analysis and demonstration site data, develop extension activities addressing farming systems fit for new or established soft wheat varieties, agronomy and financial analysis to support grower adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be co-dependant milestones between this procurement and a GRDC investment in market engagement and grower value proposition for new, higher-value soft wheat export market alternatives to low protein hard wheat. GRDC will form a working group including the successful applicant and a Grains Australia Limited representative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health Disability and Ageing (Department) seeks to engage laboratory services to support the delivery of the National Wastewater Surveillance Program (National Program) through the collection, testing, and analysis of wastewater samples, at up to 50 sites across Australia. Laboratories will be required to undertake surveillance for the following priority pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A (including H5), influenza B, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and poliovirus (refer to Section 2.8 of the RFT for further details). They must also have the capacity to undertake WWS for emerging threats, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) or monkeypox virus (MPXV) at minimal additional cost if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital Earth Africa is a program that exists to improve the lives of people across the African continent by translating Earth observations into insights that will support sustainable development. The Digital Earth Africa platform and services enable African governments, industry and decision makers to track changes across the continent in unprecedented detail. This provides valuable insights for better decision making across many areas, including flooding, drought, soil and coastal erosion, agriculture, forest cover, land use and land cover change, water availability and quality, and changes to human settlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoscience Australia requires a supplier based in Africa to transition, deliver and own the Digital Earth Africa program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services include the operation and management of Digital Earth Africa program activities, including program leadership, program delivery &amp;amp; coordination, science and product development, technology and platform, user engagement and capacity development, and communications and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PROC-9177274: Development of next-generation breeding technologies</title>
      <link>https://www.tenders.gov.au/Advert/Show/b7bb8d4a-4db4-4edd-bd6f-9bf96b98fcab</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This investment aims to develop the know-how and technical platforms required to deliver New Breeding Technologies (NBTs) for the Australian Grains Industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New breeding technologies including gene editing, targeted mutagenesis, transformation and cisgenics are genome engineering tools with the potential to accelerate genetic gain in plant breeding programs. This in-turn provides opportunities to deliver improved outcomes for Australian grain growers through development of more sustainable, resilient and profitable crops. The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) has established the Accelerating Genetic Gain Strategic Initiative to drive the implementation of NBTs. This investment is supporting new collaborations between researchers, end-users and commercial entities to improve uptake of pre-breeding research outputs, create new paths-to-market and ensure grower adoption of new genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through global engagement, several priority areas have been identified and GRDC is now seeking a response to the following open Tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme B: Creating and using genetic diversity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priority Area B.1: Development of next generation breeding technologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary of the opportunity: A suite of tools including targeted mutagenesis, gene editing, transformation and cisgenics are widely deployed in pre-breeding research. The challenge now, is how to adopt such research-scale technologies in a breeding context so that outcomes benefit Australian growers. Approaches which address both technical challenges and licencing needs by bringing together traditional and non-traditional partners, Australian and International organisations, public and private entities will be required for success. In the first instance, a focus on key trait(s) with a strong value proposition for Australian grain producers will be required to demonstrate the value and path-to-market opportunity for next generation breeding technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant SynBio Australia Collaboration Opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant SynBio Australia (PSBA) was established through a 'Step Change' investment by the Commonwealth under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), managed by Bioplatforms Australia (BPA). It comprises a national network of facilities that provide plant synthetic biology infrastructure and expertise to academic, government, and industry users. Capabilities such as plant gene editing, transformation, and genetic technology development are offered through fee-for-service, research hotel, and collaborative engagement models. GRDC supports the engagement of tenderers with BPA for access to, and partnerships with, these facilities, enabling researchers and industry to generate knowledge and apply plant synthetic biology to deliver agricultural solutions. For more information, contact Dr Darren Plett at dplett@bioplatforms.com or visit https://bioplatforms.com/synthetic-biology/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applicants must be able to demonstrate freedom to operate and strict stewardship protocols for the new breeding technologies in target crops; wheat and/or barley. GRDC is seeking a 50:50 co-investment for this contract, please refer to the GRDC budget template (https://grdc.com.au/research/partnering-in-rde-investment/other-resources) for definitions of cash and in-kind contributions. GRDC investment will be up to AUD$5.8M over 4.5yrs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging technologies enabling targeted recombination in plants can accelerate genetic gain by reducing linkage drag, promoting rare events and generating novel diversity. This AU$4.5M investment supports method development and demonstration in key crops and traits. Proposals should show market potential and encourage collaboration across sectors, including international and Australian partners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
